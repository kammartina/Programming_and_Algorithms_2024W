# Programming_and_Algorithms_2024W
This repository contains code that is part of programming assignments in Programming and Algorithms for Language Technologies in 2024W.

***ASSIGNMENTS OVERVIEW:***

**Exercise 1: Statistics**
This exercise focuses on processing and analyzing book metadata stored in JSON format. It involves implementing two functions:
get_statistics(books: list) -> dict – Computes statistics for each author, including total pages, average chapters, book titles, and publication period.
get_genres(books: list) -> list – Returns a unique list of genres from the dataset.
The goal is to practice working with dictionaries, lists, and sets while handling structured data efficiently.

**Exercise 2: Finding Paths with BFS**
This exercise focuses on implementing breadth-first search (BFS) to find a path in a labyrinth. It involves:
- Displaying the labyrinth with row and column labels.
- Prompting the user for start and end locations.
- Implementing BFS to find the shortest path from start to end.
- Marking and displaying the found path within the labyrinth.
Key concepts include queues, sets, tuple handling, and pathfinding algorithms, helping to reinforce Python skills for handling structured data and search problems.
