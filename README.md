# Programming_and_Algorithms_2024W
This repository contains code that is part of programming assignments in Programming and Algorithms for Language Technologies in 2024W.

***ASSIGNMENTS OVERVIEW:***
<br><br>
**Exercise 1: Statistics**
<br>
This exercise focuses on processing and analyzing book metadata stored in JSON format. The goal is to practice working with dictionaries, lists, and sets while handling structured data efficiently. It involves implementing two functions:
- get_statistics(books: list) -> dict – Computes statistics for each author, including total pages, average chapters, book titles, and publication period.
- get_genres(books: list) -> list – Returns a unique list of genres from the dataset.

**Exercise 2: Finding Paths with BFS**
<br>
This exercise focuses on implementing breadth-first search (BFS) to find a path in a labyrinth. Key concepts include queues, sets, tuple handling, and pathfinding algorithms, helping to reinforce Python skills for handling structured data and search problems. It involves:
- Displaying the labyrinth with row and column labels.
- Prompting the user for start and end locations.
- Implementing BFS to find the shortest path from start to end.
- Marking and displaying the found path within the labyrinth.

**Exercise 3: Python Recap – Object-Oriented Refactoring**
<br>
This exercise focuses on refactoring a procedural drawing application into an object-oriented design. The first assignment involves creating a Canvas class, encapsulating drawing functions, and introducing a Point class for better structure. The second assignment extends this by implementing a Shape class with geometric properties, such as calculating centroids and comparing shapes based on their distance from the origin. The exercise reinforces OOP principles, type hints, and packing/unpacking concepts in Python.

**Exercise 4: Text Analysis and Manipulation on Song Lyrics**
<br>
This exercise involves building a Python program to analyze song lyrics by processing text data, calculating frequencies, and reversing content. This exercise reinforces file handling, string manipulation, data processing, and logging techniques in Python. The program is:
- Storing lyrics in a file (song.txt).
- Reading and displaying the lyrics.
- Analyzing letter and word frequencies.
- Identifying frequently and infrequently used characters.
- Counting unique words and calculating their occurrence percentages.
- Reversing the lyrics and saving them in reversed.txt.
- Loging all results to execution_log.txt.

**Exercise 5: Search Engine for Shakespeare's Sonnets**
<br>
This exercise aims to build a search engine for Shakespeare's sonnets. It involves fetching sonnets via an API, converting JSON data into object-oriented representations, tokenizing and stemming text, and constructing an inverted index for efficient information retrieval. The project reinforces key concepts in API integration, OOP design, text processing, and query handling.
- Fetching Data
- Object-Oriented Conversion
- Text Processing
- Inverted Index Creation
- Query Handling and Document Abstraction
- User Interface

**Exercise 6: Tree Traversal**
<br>
This exercise challenges to implement depth-first tree traversal techniques. It reinforces key concepts in recursion, iteration, tree data structures, and object-oriented design. It involves:
- Creating a TreeNode class to represent tree nodes.
- Implementing both recursive and iterative in-order traversal functions.
- Extending the TreeNode class with object-oriented traversal methods for in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals using a visitor function.
