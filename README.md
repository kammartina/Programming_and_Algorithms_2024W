# Programming_and_Algorithms_2024W
This repository contains code that is part of programming assignments in Programming and Algorithms for Language Technologies in 2024W.

***ASSIGNMENTS OVERVIEW:***

**Exercise 1: Statistics**
This exercise focuses on processing and analyzing book metadata stored in JSON format. It involves implementing two functions:
- get_statistics(books: list) -> dict – Computes statistics for each author, including total pages, average chapters, book titles, and publication period.
- get_genres(books: list) -> list – Returns a unique list of genres from the dataset.
The goal is to practice working with dictionaries, lists, and sets while handling structured data efficiently.

**Exercise 2: Finding Paths with BFS**
This exercise focuses on implementing breadth-first search (BFS) to find a path in a labyrinth. It involves:
- Displaying the labyrinth with row and column labels.
- Prompting the user for start and end locations.
- Implementing BFS to find the shortest path from start to end.
- Marking and displaying the found path within the labyrinth.
Key concepts include queues, sets, tuple handling, and pathfinding algorithms, helping to reinforce Python skills for handling structured data and search problems.

**Exercise 3: Python Recap – Object-Oriented Refactoring**
This exercise focuses on refactoring a procedural drawing application into an object-oriented design. The first assignment involves creating a Canvas class, encapsulating drawing functions, and introducing a Point class for better structure. The second assignment extends this by implementing a Shape class with geometric properties, such as calculating centroids and comparing shapes based on their distance from the origin. The exercise reinforces OOP principles, type hints, and packing/unpacking concepts in Python.

**Exercise 4: Text Analysis and Manipulation on Song Lyrics**
This exercise involves building a Python program to analyze song lyrics by processing text data, calculating frequencies, and reversing content. The program will:
- Store lyrics in a file (song.txt).
- Read and display the lyrics.
- Analyze letter and word frequencies.
- Identify frequently and infrequently used characters.
- Count unique words and calculate their occurrence percentages.
- Reverse the lyrics and save them in reversed.txt.
- Log all results to execution_log.txt.
This exercise reinforces file handling, string manipulation, data processing, and logging techniques in Python.
